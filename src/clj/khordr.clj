;; Behaviors 

;; Behaviors: a sequence of pairs, each of which is a selector and a
;; handler specifier. The selector is a function of one argument that
;; will be invoked with a key name (e.g. :a). If the selector returns
;; true, the first element of the specifier is invoked with the result
;; of calling the selector. As a special case, the selector may be a
;; keyword, which matches only itself.

;; TODO: the DSL here needs to be more fleshed-out once we use it as a
;; serialization format.
